# Ecomm_RAG-LLM_recommender
# 🛍️ Personalized Recommendation System using RAG and LLMs

A powerful, intelligent e-commerce recommendation system that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to deliver highly relevant, context-aware product suggestions. This system enhances user experience by understanding complex, natural language queries and matching them to relevant items in a diverse product dataset.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional search and recommendation systems face significant limitations:

- ❌ Inability to understand nuanced natural language queries
- ❌ Poor contextual awareness (e.g., fashion styles, seasonal trends)
- ❌ Generic, one-size-fits-all recommendations
- ❌ Limited personalization, leading to lower user engagement

This project aims to overcome these issues by creating an intelligent, multimodal recommendation engine using **RAG**, **LLMs**, and **vector embeddings** — improving both accuracy and user satisfaction in online shopping environments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ **Store a diverse product dataset** by converting product data into **vector embeddings** and saving them in an efficient **Vector Store Index**.
- ✅ **Enable natural language understanding** using LLMs to interpret nuanced user queries and preferences.
- ✅ **Build a RAG-based system** where:
  - **Retrievers** fetch the most relevant results from the vector store.
  - **LLM-based synthesizers** generate human-like responses and personalized suggestions.
- ✅ **Develop domain-specific chatbots** using dedicated knowledge bases and vector indexes tailored for different businesses or product categories.

## 🔭 Scope of the Project

### 📦 1. Vector-Based Product Representation
- Embed all product metadata into vector form using transformer-based models (e.g., SentenceTransformers).
- Store these vectors in a scalable **vector store** (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate).

### 💬 2. Custom Chatbot Frameworks
- Create modular chatbots backed by **custom vector stores** containing domain-specific product data.
- Support for **multi-brand**, **multi-category**, or **multi-platform** deployments.

### 🧠 3. Intelligent Recommendations via RAG
- Combine a retriever + generator pipeline to power:
  - Personalized recommendations
  - Dynamic response generation
  - Multi-turn user interaction

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- `Python 3.x`
- `LlamaIndex` (for vector store, RAG, LLM orchestration)
- `Hugging Face Transformers` (for embeddings or optional LLM)
- `OpenAI`, `Gemini`, `Mistral`, or local LLMs (LLM backends)
- `Gradio` or `Streamlit` (for interactive UI)
